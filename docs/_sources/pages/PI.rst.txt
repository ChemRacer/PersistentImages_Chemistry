Persistent Images

This is the explanation of Persistence Images.

What is TDA?
^^^^^^^^^^^^
Topology is a branch of mathematics that analyzes shape and important characteristics of an object. In topological data analysis, we apply these techniques to the shape and important characteristics of a data set. One such technique is persistent homology, which tracks the appearance and disappearance of homological features such as connected components and holes. These features appear in a topological descriptor called persistence diagrams containing the evolution of the connected components and holes from birth to death. A persistence diagram can then be converted to a finite-dimensional version of itself.
