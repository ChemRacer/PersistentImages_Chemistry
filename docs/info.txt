Hello Aaron (or whoever is building documentation),

I have included in this file some information about how we're going to
go about building the documentation. 

1. How to edit the documentation

	1) Go into docs/source and find the file (.rst suffix) you want to edit
    	- index.rst is the home page of the file
	2) Make your edits according to .rst syntax
	3) Go to PersistentImages_Chemistry/helpers
	4) Run ./update_docs.sh
   		- May need to run “chmod +x update_docs.sh” before doing the above 
		   (creates an executable)
	5) git add docs
 	6) git commit -m “Some message about update”
	7) git push origin master
	8) Now you can go open the website on the GitHub

2. Platform on which we are building documentation

	- The platform that we're running on is called "Sphinx", and it's a 
		documentation-building tool.
		> For general info: https://docs.readthedocs.io/en/stable/intro/getting-started-with-sphinx.html

	- We edit files called rst files (stands for restructured text)
		> These .rst files are compiled into HTML files through the command
		   ran in the "docs" folder: make html (using a Makefile)
		> You don't have to worry about compiling, this is what the shell script
			does for us (update_docs.sh)

	- The style for this documentation is in "classic" right now, which is a
		style used in old-school Python documentation
		> I think this is a pretty clean style, but if you feel like changing it,
			let me know and we can take a look at it
			- Link to style guide: https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/1.8/theming.html
		> The style is defined in the conf.py file in docs folder

	- The index.html is the home page for the website
		> If you want to view your changes without pushing to GitHub, you can
			run "open docs/index.html" from the main directory or 
			"open index.html" from the docs directory
		> This page should link to all the other pages in the website

	- Since we are editing in .rst files, we need to follow rst syntax or the 
		compilation will not work (I've run into this problem a few times
		already)
		> Basic guide on syntax: https://pythonhosted.org/an_example_pypi_project/sphinx.html

Please feel free to ask any questions!
